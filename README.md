# Code-challenges

### Git Workflow

- Fork the Code-challenges repo [For the first time work].
- Clone the repo.
- For the new pushed challenges just pull and fetch the new commits

### How to work in the code challenges:

- We will have to challenges / week.

- You need to work on these challenges in pairs (in the pair channel).

- When you finished , each pair should push the solution and create a pull request to your branch in Code-challenges-C18 repo.
- Add a commit with the name of the challenge (W1T1)

- At each technical live session we will choose one pair randomly to solve one of the challenges.
  (first challenge in the first session, the second challenge in the second session).
